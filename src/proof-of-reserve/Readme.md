# Proof of Reserve overview

The Proof of Reserve is a protocol developed by Chainlink that facilitates dependable surveillance of reserve assets, providing a data feed that can be accessed directly on-chain. Within the Dinari protocol, the Proof of Reserve system is utilized to maintain robust oversight of assets.

In the event of an anomaly being identified in a single asset, the Proof of Reserve mechanism will react swiftly, aiming to enforce the most stringent protective measures possible on the corresponding pool. This system is instrumental in maintaining the integrity and stability of the protocol, thereby ensuring a high level of trust and security for all participants.

The necessary smart contracts for the implementation of the Proof of Reserve mechanism within the Dinari protocol are contained within the provided directory. These contracts have been meticulously constructed to ensure seamless integration with the Dinari protocol, thereby facilitating optimal asset protection.
